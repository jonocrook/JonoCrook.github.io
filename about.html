    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, my name is <strong>Jonathan Crook</strong>. I’m currently studying at the Australian Catholic University <a href="https://www.acu.edu.au/"(ACU)>(ACU)</a>, working towards becoming a TAS (Technological and Applied Studies) teacher. I have a strong interest in hands-on, practical learning and am passionate about helping students engage with real-world problem solving through design and technology.
    Alongside my studies, I work as a Learn to Swim instructor at <em>Macquarie University Aququatic Centre</em>. This role has helped me build strong communication and teaching skills, especially when working with younger learners. I enjoy creating positive learning environments whether in the pool or the classroom and look forward to continuing to grow as an educator.</p>  </div>

<h2>My Background</h2>
<img src="images/ProfilePicture.png.png"width=200px>
<p>I am currently undertaking a double degree at Australian Catholic University: Bachelor of Secondary Education and Bachelor of Design Innovation and Technologies. This pathway allows me to combine my passion for teaching with a strong foundation in creativity, problem-solving, and practical design skills, preparing me to teach TAS subjects across multiple stages.</p>
<p>Alongside my university studies, I work as a Learn to Swim Instructor, where I teach babies, teenagers, and adults. This role has provided me with valuable experience in adapting communication to suit different age groups and learning needs, fostering patience, and building strong relationships with learners and their families. These skills directly influence my classroom practice, enabling me to better engage students, create supportive learning environments, and communicate instructions clearly and effectively.</p>
