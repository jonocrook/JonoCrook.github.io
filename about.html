    <p>Hi, my name is <strong>Jonathan Crook</strong>. Iâ€™m currently studying at the Australian Catholic University <a href="https://www.acu.edu.au/"(ACU)>(ACU)</a>, working towards becoming a TAS (Technological and Applied Studies) teacher. I have a strong interest in hands-on, practical learning and am passionate about helping students engage with real-world problem solving through design and technology.
    Alongside my studies, I work as a Learn to Swim instructor at <em>Macquarie University Aququatic Centre</em>. This role has helped me build strong communication and teaching skills, especially when working with younger learners. I enjoy creating positive learning environments whether in the pool or the classroom and look forward to continuing to grow as an educator.</p>
