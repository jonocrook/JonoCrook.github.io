<h2>Professional Summary</h2>
    <li>I am currently studying at Australian Catholic University to become a Technology and Applied Studies (TAS) teacher, with a strong focus on hands-on, practical learning and student engagement. Alongside my studies, I work as a Learn to Swim Teacher at Macquarie University Aquatic Centre, where I have developed skills in communication, behaviour management, and tailoring instruction to meet the needs of diverse learners.</li>
    <li>Through my university program, I have successfully completed two professional placements within the TAS faculty, where I gained experience in lesson planning, classroom management, and delivering engaging learning sequences across timber, design, and technology contexts. These placements strengthened my ability to connect curriculum content to real-world applications, while also reinforcing the importance of building positive relationships with students.</li>
