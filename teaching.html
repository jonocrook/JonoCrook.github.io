    <h1>Teaching Practice</h1>
    <p>I believe teaching is about empowering students to discover their strengths and see the value in learning by doing. In my future classroom, I want to create an environment where students feel encouraged to try new things, take risks, and be proud of what they create. My lessons will focus on practical experiences that spark curiosity and creativity. I want students to see connections between what they learn at school and the world outside, helping them understand that design, problem-solving, and making have real purpose and impact. More than just teaching content, I want to inspire students to develop confidence, resilience, and a mindset that embraces challenges. Every project is a chance for them to practise persistence, teamwork, and critical thinking – skills that matter far beyond the classroom. By introducing students to tools, technologies, and design processes, I hope to nurture a love for creating and innovating. Whether it’s exploring sustainable design solutions, experimenting with materials, or developing new ideas, my goal is to prepare students for both future pathways and lifelong learning.</p>

    <h1>Teaching Practice</h1>
    <p><strong>Learning Opens Opportunities:</strong> I believe that education is the key that unlocks doors. The more students learn, the more confident and capable they become in navigating both their studies and their lives beyond school. Knowledge empowers them to take on challenges, explore possibilities, and discover new pathways.</p>
    <p><strong>Every Student Can Grow:</strong> I see all students as capable learners. No matter their starting point, I believe in meeting them where they are, supporting them with strategies and encouragement, and helping them progress at their own pace. Growth, not perfection, is the ultimate goal.</p>
    <p><strong>Relevance and Connection Matter:</strong> I believe that learning is most powerful when it feels meaningful. By connecting lessons to real-world experiences, interests, and future possibilities, I aim to make learning engaging, authentic, and purposeful.</p>
    <p><strong>Respect and Relationships First:</strong> Strong relationships form the foundation of effective teaching. I believe in creating a classroom culture built on respect, trust, and inclusivity, where students feel safe to take risks, make mistakes, and express themselves freely.</p>
    <p><strong>Teaching is Lifelong Learning:</strong> I believe that teachers are learners too. Just as I encourage curiosity and growth in my students, I strive to keep learning, reflecting, and adapting in my own practice to ensure I am meeting the needs of all learners.</p>
