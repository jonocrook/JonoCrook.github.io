    <section class="section">
    <p>I believe teaching is about empowering students to discover their strengths and see the value in learning by doing. In my future classroom, I want to create an environment where students feel encouraged to try new things, take risks, and be proud of what they create. My lessons will focus on practical experiences that spark curiosity and creativity. I want students to see connections between what they learn at school and the world outside, helping them understand that design, problem-solving, and making have real purpose and impact. More than just teaching content, I want to inspire students to develop confidence, resilience, and a mindset that embraces challenges. Every project is a chance for them to practise persistence, teamwork, and critical thinking – skills that matter far beyond the classroom. By introducing students to tools, technologies, and design processes, I hope to nurture a love for creating and innovating. Whether it’s exploring sustainable design solutions, experimenting with materials, or developing new ideas, my goal is to prepare students for both future pathways and lifelong learning.</p>
